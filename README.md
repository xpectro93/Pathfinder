# Pathfinder
This project visualizes how different algorithms work.

## General Info
Pathfinder is a project created with the aim to show how some algorithms work.  
This project uses Dijkstra's, A* and Prim's algorithm to accomplish this task.
You can either create your own maze and use an algorithm to solve it, or use an algorithm to construct a randomly generated maze for the algorithms to find the shortest path to the target location.
## Motivation
While working on my own version of Pac-man, I encountered a problem when it came to generating the movement for the ghosts.
I could either make them move randomly, OR I could find out how I could replicate the movement of the original game.
After taking looking it, I came accross different search algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A*, I quickly became fascinated by them.
As a software developer, I thrive on the opportunity to learn something new and to solve problems , so I went forth and created this project to show how amazing algorithms can be.
